### Hello world!

- 👋🏾 Nice to meet you! My name is Rajath, and I'm a student at Harvard pursuing a Bachelors in Physics, a Masters in Applied Mathematics, and a minor in Computer Science.
- 🤔 If I had to pick a metaphor to describe myself, I would characterize myself as a point particle in phase space with extremely stochastic dynamics.
- 🔭 I’m currently building generative chemistry models for drug discovery at [PostEra](https://postera.ai/).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects that sit on the intersection of physical/life sciences and technology. 
- 💬 Excited about physics, computational chemistry, drug discovery, machine learning, quantitative finance, and neuroscience.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at rajathsalegame@college.harvard.edu!
