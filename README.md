### Hello world!

👋🏾 Nice to meet you! My name is Rajath, and I'm a student at Harvard pursuing a Bachelors in Physics, a Masters in Applied Mathematics, and a minor in Computer Science.

🤔 If I had to pick a metaphor to describe myself, I would characterize myself as a point particle in phase space with extremely stochastic dynamics. I was enamored by molecular biology and biochemistry (and was a dedicated bench scientist) and until the end of my first year of college, when I fell in love with more quantitative forms of thinking like physics and math. Since then, I've explored a variety of different fields, like experimental biophysics, computational physics/chemistry, and quantitative finance, and have picked up some CS skills along the way.

🔭 Most recently, I am building generative chemistry models for drug discovery on a leave of absence from Harvard at [PostEra](https://postera.ai/).

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects that sit on the intersection of physical/life sciences and technology.

💬 Excited about physics, computational chemistry, drug discovery, machine learning, quantitative finance, and neuroscience. But perhaps most broadly, I'm excited about reinventing the future of humanity through science and technology! 

📫 How to reach me: email me at rajathsalegame@college.harvard.edu or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RSalegame)!
